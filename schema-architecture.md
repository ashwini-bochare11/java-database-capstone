A SpringBoot healthcare system architecture where users interact through Admin and Doctor Dashboards, which send requests to Thymeleaf-based controllers. These controllers forward the actions to a centralized service layer that processes business logic and coordinates data flow. For structured data like patients and appointments, the service layer uses JPA repositories to access a MySQL database, while for unstructured data such as prescriptions, it relies on MongoDB repositories connected to a MongoDB database. The model layer distinguishes between relational entities and document-based models, ensuring clear domain separation. This hybrid design enables efficient handling of both structured and flexible medical data in a scalable, modular way.This Spring Boot application uses both MVC and REST controllers. Thymeleaf templates are used for the Admin and Doctor dashboards, while REST APIs serve all other modules. The application interacts with two databasesâ€”MySQL (for patient, doctor, appointment, and admin data) and MongoDB (for prescriptions). All controllers route requests through a common service layer, which in turn delegates to the appropriate repositories. MySQL uses JPA entities while MongoDB uses document models.

 7-step flow outlining how data and control move through the healthcare system illustrated in your image:
- User Interaction via Dashboards: Admins and doctors interact with the system through the AdminDashboard and DoctorDashboard interfaces, which send requests to the backend.
- Thymeleaf Controllers: These user actions are routed through Thymeleaf-based controllers, which process the request and determine the appropriate service to invoke.
- Service Layer Processing: Controllers delegate business logic and operations to the Service Layer, which acts as the brain of the system, orchestrating data flow.
- MySQL Repository Access: For structured data like patients, doctors, appointments, and admins, the Service Layer communicates with MySQL repositories using JPA.
- MySQL Database Interaction: These repositories access and persist data in the MySQL database, mapping data to JPA entities and underlying models.
- MongoDB Repository Access: When dealing with unstructured or document-based data like prescriptions, the Service Layer switches to using MongoDB repositories.
- MongoDB Database Interaction: The MongoDB repositories handle CRUD operations for prescription documents, which are stored in the MongoDB database and mapped to MongoDB models.
