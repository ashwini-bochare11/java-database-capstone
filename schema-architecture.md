A SpringBoot healthcare system architecture where users interact through Admin and Doctor Dashboards, which send requests to Thymeleaf-based controllers. These controllers forward the actions to a centralized service layer that processes business logic and coordinates data flow. For structured data like patients and appointments, the service layer uses JPA repositories to access a MySQL database, while for unstructured data such as prescriptions, it relies on MongoDB repositories connected to a MongoDB database. The model layer distinguishes between relational entities and document-based models, ensuring clear domain separation. This hybrid design enables efficient handling of both structured and flexible medical data in a scalable, modular way.This Spring Boot application uses both MVC and REST controllers. Thymeleaf templates are used for the Admin and Doctor dashboards, while REST APIs serve all other modules. The application interacts with two databasesâ€”MySQL (for patient, doctor, appointment, and admin data) and MongoDB (for prescriptions). All controllers route requests through a common service layer, which in turn delegates to the appropriate repositories. MySQL uses JPA entities while MongoDB uses document models.
